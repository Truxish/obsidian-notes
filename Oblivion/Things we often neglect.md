**state-1** => you have no idea where to start, you don't know how to think about it, you don't know how to ask questions, you don't know where to put our efforts into.

(Relevance)

 **Signs that you are are state-1**
 
 - Lost and confused
 - Mind-blank
 - Overwhelming

 **Signs of progression through state-1**
   - Start realizing that there are more variables to think and care about i.e you are now discovering new variables about the skill you are trying to master.
   - State Irrelevant becomes State relevant 

The fact is you are not getting better in doing the skill, you can't do it properly at this state, but you are progressing and that is the only thing which matter in this state.

**Actions that lead to progression in this state**

- Exploration:- Try to understand as much Theory related to the thing to develop an intuition.
- challenging:- Be open minded by challenging our own believes and ideas, "what we think is important right now, might not be correct"

after this relevance state you must be knowing "**what to care about**, you know **what the variables are"**

Now what?

**State-2** :- we are trying to perform the skill but we are consistently failing, sometimes we know why are we failing and sometimes we don't

we also don't seem to be making any progress

In this state, we consistently make mistakes. Its frustrating and demotivating.

But that's why its called awareness state

We're getting more aware of our mistakes.

**Signs that you re progressing through this state**
- Think it this way, in order to learn the skill correctly you need to correct every mistake you are doing.
- Progress is about making as many mistakes as possible not consciously making mistakes but its happening.

Once you know how to overcome mistakes, doing it correctly happens by default.

**Actions that lead to progression in state-2**

- Experimentation => Trying to perform skill correctly and making mistakes. 
- Reflection => Thinking about what those mistakes were and why you made them.

Awareness is about knowing more things so we can overcome them.

**state-3** => we finally overcome our mistakes and know how to do things correctly, however it still takes a lot of efforts to do the thing, you are constantly overthinking about not doing the mistakes anymore and you are pretty slow at doing the things cuz the skill is very new to you. 

Your consistency is soo bad that you might do the thing correctly 4 times or 2 times out of 10.

That's why state-3 is called Iteration.

**Signs you are at state-3: Iteration**

- Able to perform the technique correctly at least once or twice.

- Not discovering any new mistakes but struggling to overcome them every time.


**Signs of progression through state-3: Iteration**

- Your consistency is improving, and you are able to do the technique higher percentage of times.
- You start to feel that the execution is becoming easier.
- You are doing the technique faster.

And it should be in that order, if you try to go faster without having the consistency of doing the correctly more no. of times or accuracy, you'll eventually become more prone to errors, main reason of getting demotivated and giving up at this point.

**Actions that lead to progression in state-3: Iteration**

Varied Practice:-
practicing more no. of times also in different context, try using your skill in different set of problems.

Adjust:- 
observe and fine tune, your technique so as to maintain the consistency of doing as the same way in different contexts.

and after the no of iterations you will notice that you are able to perform the skill with a high level of consistency and min level of efforts involved.

**state-4** : When skill becomes habit
Now you have to keep doing the skill so many times in no of spaced repetitions, other wise it will decay overtime.
