The thing is, you are going to exist in states no matter what, life is not about success, its not about having one thing and doing that all your life, its almost all the time about how you are going to live in certain state, and its you who are going to decide what you really want and how you really want to live in certain state, money matters but only to an extent, its about how you living in certain state so leave this thought that i haven't found my passion yet so I must not work, this is a vague thinking and not productive at all. I must improve my thinking and this is the way, i must not regret about anything cuz i was thinking bad but this is the truly the actual way to think.

How to tackle certain state and live is you are going to decide, learning takes time thats why you are categorised by your age, learn what ever tf you want and live that certain state. But you should have certain skills to sustain in life. 

Oke, now I know what's the reality of life now let's understand why this method was made, method of making most of the life, as charles bukowski said "fall in love with one thing and die with it" it certainly making sense if you want to reach the state of your improvement to the level where you can absolutely find the complex dynamics of the working of the world, if you want to reach that destination, do one thing and make most out of it. 

I should understand this thing that i want to learn software development so that i can make most of out of the thing which are happening in physics world, I want that creativity in me, I want to work in physics and make the most of computers utilize them we can make the, I was so away from this thinking, things are not often tough we just make them. Our intelligence is the reason why are we sad most of the time.
