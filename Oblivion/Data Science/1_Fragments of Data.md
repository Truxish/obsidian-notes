![[Data Fragments]]Full of abstractions this whole Universe is, Earth is so big, so resourceful, so dense with the information that its really hard to understand each and every relation Earth is possessing with the outer Universe, if we go and understand each and everything about the earth we will know each aspect of the Earth that we would hardly have wondered before.

What humans have done so far is to create fragments of those information which might be in relation with some other objects that posses the same mechanics as earth to understand "what earth really is, intuitively."

Each of these relations can be defined in a tabulated form or can make a statistic out of it, and we can know about the earth better by doing that, by relating different information with each other. We always want to know more, and find more solutions to the problems.

[[Project, ether-planets]]
This project showcases an idea to demonstrate all those pieces of information i.e. fragments of data and their relations with each other.
