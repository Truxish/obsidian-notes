from [[Ish's state theory]]

*high level overview of brain*
Brain is a complex dynamic system containing sub-systems and where subsystems contain states and all are densely connected by the brain waves.

But Ish, don't you think that waves are not physical, I mean they represent the variability of some physical effect and aren't physical themselves.

Yes you are right, in biology brain is connected through the electrical impulses that are generated from the chemical reactions happening in sub-systems and through each states. Where the electrons which are moving in the form of impulse, with some specific potential, effect the functioning of the other sub-system, where that impulse acted as a input. okeeeeeee.

How great the effect is, should depend on the potential of wave. I mean that's something I am comprehending from understanding how the brain works. But I might be wrong. Lets dive more.

High level overview done. Now draw that shit

Let's dive more and go very deep in the ocean
