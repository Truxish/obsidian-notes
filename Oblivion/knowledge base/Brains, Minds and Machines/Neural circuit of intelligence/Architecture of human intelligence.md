The exciting experiment of Charles Spearman

Experimented:- The relation between academic scores and sensory discrimination abilities among students.

Area: The children's of 2 different schools involved.

Objective: He collected the data of academic scores and sensory discrimination abilities of the students. and also different cognitive dynamic tasks to find out the relationship between all of them.

What he found: 
He found out, that most of the students who are good academically, are good at discriminating sensory stimuli and responses on a higher level of deepness.

He also found out that non obvious and deep, did not have to come out this way!

What he inferred:- Spearman said, there's a general factor of intelligence 'g', as he found that individuals who performed well on one type of cognitive task tended to perform well others, suggesting a common underlying factor that contributes to performance across different tasks. This 'g' factor represents general cognitive ability.

In addition, Spearman said some tasks that include information and abilities that are specific to that task only, most they are not related with any of the other tasks, so there's a specific factor of intelligence too 's'.
