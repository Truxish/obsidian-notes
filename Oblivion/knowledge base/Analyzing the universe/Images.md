(Image, I1) = represents some ongoing process in that specific point of time. 

I mean how? How can we record some configuration of process happening in that particular point of time, fuck that right now, Jaldi bas khali jo jaruri thing hai usko samkjha kar. 

What we can extract from the images we see around us, specifically astronomic images?

3 things

1:- Time of Arrival (TOA)
2:- Spatial position and resolution
3:- Energy content

How will you find the **Time of Arrival** of any radiation that is coming towards your eyes? 

$t(arrival)​=t(emission)​+c/d$

t^a = time of arrival of the radiation to the observer

t^e = time of emission of the radiation from the 
source most taken as reference 0.

c = speed of light

d = distance between the source and the observer​

2:- **Spatial resolution and position**

2 different things to begin with.

Spatial resolution means how good your sensor is, to detect each and every photon that is being emitted from the source, as each photon represents some information about the object that we are detecting. 

size and diameter of the sensor plays a crucial role in enhancing the spatial resolution of the images taken.

Imagine that far away car, with two headlamps, humko ek hi headlamp ki tarah dikhte hai as not clear smokey image, why cuz our eyes couldn't detect or sense each photon cuz of its small size and the nature of light is already diversion to end with.

What is spatial position? 
Images helps us understand where the specific place in space this particular source is located at. How can we do that? is something we'll learn next on but to get an intuition about the following, we transform pixel coordinates from the images to some galactic coordinate system, idk about that.

3 :- Energy content
Those specific frequency of lights from the objects, we can analyse them and find out the different mechanics of the object.

......

How images are formed though? 

![[Image formation]]
idk how it turned out so small lol

huh! first productive day after soooo long. 

X-RAY Images? 
how can we detect xray sources in the sky, when the high frequency and very small wavelengths of xrays just penetrate every detector we use to image them?

We use mirrors that are slanting...
