Ever felt frustrated in doing some project and not getting what I want? May be its not on you may be that's how that system of planning and charts work.

We always want 2 things in our control on any project i.e. control and predictability this leads to vast numbers of documents and graphs and charts, <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">just like at Lockheed</mark>. Months of effort go into planning every detail, so there will be no mistakes, no cost overruns, and things will be delivered on schedule.

But in reality all this planning hardly unfolds, instead projects are delayed, come in over budget and in too many cases, end in abject failure.
