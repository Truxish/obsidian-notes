Stars and Bars method
Math is methodical, you can solve a problem in various ways but what is the easiest way to do that is something which matters.

Amanda has three children: Dawn, Keesha and Seth.

    Amanda has ten one dollar bills and decides to give the full amount to her children. How many ways can she do this? For example, one way she might distribute the funds is to give Dawn and Keesha four dollars each with Seth receiving the balanceâ€”two dollars. Another way is to give the entire amount to Keesha, an option that probably wonâ€™t make Dawn and Seth very happy. Note that hidden within this question is the assumption that Amanda does not distinguish the individual dollar bills, say by carefully examining their serial numbers. Instead, we intend that she need only decide the _amount_ each of the three children is to receive.

**Stars and Bars Method**

("$*"*)'s represent items, in this case dollars.

("|")s represent dividers that separate the groups.

No. of bars will always be 1 less than the no of groups.

The formula to deteremine the no of ways to distribute "n" indistinguishable items into "k" distinguishable groups is given by 

$c(n+kâˆ’1â€‹, k-1)$,

applying, c(10+2, 2)

66 ways Amanda can distribute the chocolates among 3 kids.
