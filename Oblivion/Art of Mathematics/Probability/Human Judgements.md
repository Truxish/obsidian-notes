Human judgments are based, on certain events in life, they are sometimes immediate thoughts which are originated through biases, stereotypes and all the other deterministic events.

Maybe **rational** or **irrational**

But as we living in the mathematical world, we need to understand that what is the mathematical perspective, and it certainly defines the relevance of certain facts.

**Let's understand this from a query,**

Steve is very shy and withdrawn invariably helpful but with very little interest in people or in  the world of reality. A meek and tidy soul, he has a need for order and structure, and a passion for detail.

Guess what Steve is, a librarian or a farmer?

My first judgement which was pretty immediate, that Steve is more librarian than a farmer given his personality traits. And not only me but most of the people who were asked this question guessed that Steve should be a farmer. And all these judgments were coined irrational by the 2 psychologists Kahneman and Tversky who were initially involved in doing this experiment with human judgments.

BTW the experiment was focused on how frequent does these judgments contradicts the laws of probabilities in math.

But we're not really focused on judging if these irrational believes are right or wrong,
but on the fact that statically no one even thought of the ratio of the 
**no. of farmers/ no. of librarians**
