  <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">State</mark>:
- State is an array of variables, representing "difference" in time, variability, opinions, rate, actions.

Also I can define a particular state as which defines the actions of certain processes the certainly different way than in other states.

States are pretty good way to categorize generality.

for example:- ![[Linting System]]
In Linting system, states can be defined in two variables, the initial state of the code is (x1) and when the linting code changes according to user's specific configuration (x2) in the linting code.
