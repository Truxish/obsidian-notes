Imagine all the colours of your painting being made, everytime you use it?

So unprofessional right? we want our dev process to be very easy.

we will create a file full of the styles that we are going to use time by time, give them a name that is easy to use.

That file will be our tailwind.config.ts file and we will make one more file for doing the same stuff but for colours and other styles in our theme.css file later on.
